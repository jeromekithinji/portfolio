                My name is Jerome Kithinji. Iâ€™m a full-stack developer & freelance web developer. I create innovative solutions that bridge technology and user experience. I'm passionate about design, technology and basically everything that makes the internet tick.

                My work currently consists of a Software Development internship role at Telkom Kenya (working on their HRM & CRM systems). Alongside this, I actively participate in various freelance projects and side projects. I find this balancing act to be super resourceful in terms my learning as a developer, as well as for keeping up with the rapid expansion of developer tools, libraries, frameworks, etc.
